# Tanzania_water_pump_prediction

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the functional status of water pumps in Tanzania, specifically whether they are functional, need repairs, or are non-functional. This information can be used to prioritize maintenance and repairs, as well as to identify areas in need of new water pump installations.

## Data

The data for this project is sourced from the "Tanzania Water Pumps Status" dataset available on DrivenData (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). The dataset contains information about water pumps in Tanzania, including geographical location, type, and functional status.

## Requirements

In order to run this project, you will need the following software and packages installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Scikit-learn
7. Procedure
   The procedure for this project is as follows:

- Load and clean the data
- Exploratory data analysis
- eature engineering and selection
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation and fine-tuning
- Making predictions on new data

## Conclusion

By following the procedure outlined above, a machine learning model can be built to predict the functional status of water pumps in Tanzania. This model can be used to prioritize maintenance and repairs, as well as to identify areas in need of new water pump installations.
